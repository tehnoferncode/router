# React Routing & Protected Routes – Real-World Example

This project demonstrates how **routing works in real React applications**
using **Login, Dashboard, and Protected Routes**.

It is designed for **students and beginners** to understand how
authentication-based navigation works in **admin panels, dashboards,
and SaaS apps**.

## 🚀 What This Project Covers

- React Router setup
- Public and protected routes
- Login → Dashboard flow
- Redirect if user is not authenticated
- Logout and route protection
- Real-world navigation structure

---

## 🧠 Why Routing is Important in React

Without routing:
- A React app feels incomplete
- No page navigation
- No real application flow

With routing:
- Multiple pages (Login, Dashboard, etc.)
- Access control
- Better user experience
- Industry-ready structure

---

## 🔐 What are Protected Routes?

Protected routes are pages that:
- **Require authentication**
- Cannot be accessed directly by URL
- Redirect unauthenticated users to Login page

Example:
- `/dashboard` → accessible only after login
- `/login` → public page

## 🌍 Real-World Use Cases

This exact pattern is used in:
- Admin panels
- E-commerce dashboards
- Banking applications
- SaaS platforms
- Internal company tools
